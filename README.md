# -Extension Fucker-
This cool asf program will essentially rape a blocker of your choice thats on your Chromebook! Gain back your privacy and definitely not go on Rule34 lol


you sick fucks XDDDD


# How to use this shit
Using this is easy as rizzin' up an autistic girl! Which is pretty fuckin easy, especially if you're already sped like me. 

Anyways to use this, all you need to do is select a dumb ass spyware extension from the drop down list on the website, and then click hang extension!

After you're done with that, a black screen will pop up with the words "Click here to hang Extension". After clicking it, it will proceed to try and rape the extension into submission, and if it successfully hangs it, all you need to do is go to the Extension Settings page of the blocker and flip the "Allow access to File URLS" switch.

SIMPLE I KNOW RIGHT YEYEYEYEYEYYE
